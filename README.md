# Overview
- It was kinda hard finding designs to practise my frontend skills. So  after coming across [Frontend Mentor's](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) platform, I decided to start their challenges.

- The goal of doing these challenges is to improve my frontend skills.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
